LET. XVI.
TO THE COUNTESS OF ——.

Brunswick, Nov. 23. O. S. 1716.
    

      I AM just come to Brunswick, a very old town, but which has the advantage of being the capital of the duke of
      Wolsenbuttle's dominions, a family (not to speak of its ancient honours) illustrious, by having its younger
      branch on the throne of England, and having given two empresses to Germany. I have not forgot to drink your
      health here in mum, which I think very well deserves its reputation of being the best in the world. This letter
      is the third I have writ to you during my journey; and I declare to you, that if you don't send me
      immediately a full and true account of all the changes and chances among our London acquaintance, I will not
      write you any description of Hanover (where I hope to be to-night) though I know you have more curiosity to hear
      of that place than any other.
