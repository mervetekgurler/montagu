LET. XXII.
TO MR POPE.

Vienna, Jan. 16. O. S. 1717.
    

      I HAVE not time to answer your letter, being in the hurry of preparing for my journey; but, I think, I ought to
      bid adieu to my friends with the same solemnity as if I was going to mount a breach, at least, if I am to believe
      the information of the people here, who denounce all sorts of terrors to me; and, indeed, the weather is at
      present such, as very few ever set out in. I am threatened at the same time, with being frozen to death, buried
      in the snow, and taken by the Tartars, who ravage that part of Hungary I am to pass. 'Tis true, we shall have
      a considerable escorte (sic), so that possibly I may be diverted with a new scene, by finding myself in
      the midst of a battle. How my adventures will conclude, I leave entirely to Providence; if comically, you shall
      hear of them.—Pray be so good as to tell Mr —— I have received his letter. Make him my adieus; if I live, I will
      answer it. The same compliment to my lady R——.
