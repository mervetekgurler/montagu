LET. II
TO MRS. S——.

Hague, Aug. 5. O. S. 1716.
    

      I MAKE haste to tell you, dear Madam, that, after all the dreadful fatigues you threatened me with, I am hitherto
      very well pleased with my journey. We take care to make such short stages every day, that I rather fancy myself
      upon parties of pleasure, than upon the road; and sure nothing can be more agreeable than travelling in Holland.
      The whole country appears a large garden; the roads are well paved, shaded on each side with rows of trees, and
      bordered with large canals, full of boats, passing and repassing. Every twenty paces gives you the prospect of
      some villa, and every four hours that of a large town, so surprisingly neat, I am sure you would be charmed with
      them. The place I am now at is certainly one of the finest villages in the world. Here are several squares finely
      built, and (what I think a particular beauty) the whole set with thick large trees. The Vour-hout is, at
      the same time, the Hyde-Park and Mall of the people of quality; for they take the air in it both on foot and in
      coaches. There are shops for wafers, cool liquors, &c.—I have been to see several of the most celebrated
      gardens, but I will not teaze (sic) you with their descriptions. I dare say you think my letter already long
      enough. But I must not conclude without begging your pardon, for not obeying your commands, in sending the lace
      you ordered me. Upon my word, I can yet find none, that is not dearer than you may buy it at London. If you want
      any India goods, here are great variety of penny-worths; and I shall follow your orders with great pleasure and
      exactness; being, Dear Madam, &c. &c.
